# adr/ — what belongs here

## Belongs here

- One decision per topic, `ADR-<nnnn>.md`: a `**Status:**` line, Context (ending
  with *Alternatives considered*), Decision, Consequences and, once revised, a
  `## History`.
- Decisions this repo makes for itself. The decisions about the *standard* live
  in the kiln repo's ADR log and are rendered here as
  `.rn-forge/kiln/standard.md`, not copied.

## Does not belong here

| Instead of | Put it in |
| -- | -- |
| How something works now | `architecture/` |
| A plan | `specs/` |
| A list of verbs, paths or fields | the reference, or the owning feature's design |

## Naming and shape

- Numbers are contiguous from `0001` and never reused.
- The filename is the number alone, so a revision never renames the file or
  moves a link; the title lives in the heading and in `index.md`.
- `**Status:**` is one of `proposed`, `accepted`, or `deprecated` — the last
  when the decision no longer applies and nothing replaced it.
- About a page. An ADR that starts enumerating has become a spec.

## Changing this area

**A new topic** takes the next number:

1. `**Status:**` — `proposed` or `accepted`.
1. `## Context`, ending with `### Alternatives considered`: each rejected option
   and why.
1. `## Decision` — the choice, specific enough to be wrong.
1. `## Consequences` — what it makes easy, what it rules out.
1. Add it to `index.md` with its title.

**A change to an existing decision** revises that ADR in place — never a second
ADR for the same topic, and never a `superseded` status:

1. Rewrite Context, Decision and Consequences to say what is true now.
1. Add a dated entry at the top of `## History`, at the end of the file: what
   the ADR said before, why it changed, and what survived.
1. Update the title in `index.md` if the heading changed.

A decision that stops applying with nothing to replace it becomes `deprecated`,
with a History entry saying why. An answered open question becomes an ADR, or a
rejected option recorded on the feature, and leaves the feature's page.
